      <h2>The Sars-Cov-2</h2>
      <p class = "intro">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

        <h3  >They Are The Heroes</h3>
        <p>We grew up watching movies and superhero cartoons like Super Man, Spider Man, Luffy etc. Even today many of my friends watches super hero movies, Marvel Studios are just on every bodies tongue. Although there is nothing wrong in watching movies and entertaining overselves but At the end of the day it's all fictional, Unfortunately they don't come to help us in reality... They are not helping us in this pendemic. But don't worry guys we have our own real life heroes, They are The Doctors, Farmers, Police, Soldiers, Cleaners and many more. They are working day and night to ensure we are safe, we are healthy and we have everything we need.</p>
