      <h2>The Sars-Cov-2</h2>
      <p class = "intro">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

They are not helping us in this pendemic. But don't worry guys we have our own real life heroes, They are The Doctors, Farmers, Police, Soldiers, Cleaners and many more. They are working day and night to ensure we are safe, we are healthy and we have everything we need.</p>

        <h2>The Horrors of the Second wave</h2>

          Human behavior is the major factor. State and local governments, as well as individual people, differ in their response to the pandemic. Some follow COVID-19 precautions, such as physical distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing. Others are not as prescriptive in requiring these measures or in restricting certain high risk activities. In some cities, towns and communities, public places are closed or practicing limitations (such as how many people are allowed inside at one time); others are operating normally. Some government and community leaders encourage or even mandate mask wearing and physical distancing in public areas. Others say it is a matter of personal choice.

        <h2>Shortage of beds</h2>
        <img class = "indian" src = "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202104/delhi_hospitals_pti_1200x768.jpeg?iGlczrq9nE_WPB2RLdp1ttDDHryU73NW&size=770:433" alt="indian" />
        <p>
          As Covid-19 cases peaked in Delhi, breaking all previous single-day records, an India Today TV reality-check found several state-run hospital overran by the influx of patients, unable to meet the demands for beds.

In PPE kits, doctors and staff scrambled to treat Covid-19 patients, many of them waiting for hours in long queues and many others in ambulances.

Delhi's GTB Hospital, a 1,700-bed facility, was packed to capacity on Thursday though the Delhi government app at the time showed it had beds available, India Today TV found.

"There's no bed at all," a nurse on duty told India Today TV's reporter inquiring about a hospital bed for a Covid-19 positive patient. "No bed is vacant here."

        <h2>No Oxygen supply</h2>

        <p>
          Gurgaon’s Artemis Hospital had a tense Friday as staff struggled to meet oxygen demands of patients because they hadn’t received their supply for the day.

Officials at the hospital, which is treating 140 Covid patients, with 50 in the ICU, said at 10 am that the supply would only last three hours. Over the last few days, they said, the hospital had been receiving a third of its usual oxygen supply, even as demand had increased “three to five times”.
        </p>
        <h2>Increased death rates</h2>
        <img class="graph" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15128/production/_118121368_death-nc.png" alt="graph" />
        <p>
          A big rise in infections in April and May, driven largely by the more infectious and dangerous Delta variant, brought India's health system to its knees.

India has officially reported 403,281 deaths out of 29.75 million people who have contracted the virus.

While the country of 1.35 billion people has reported fewer deaths than the United States and Brazil some experts believe its actual case and fatality numbers are several times higher.
